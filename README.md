# Odin Landing Page

Live Preview [Here](https://kennyputman.github.io/odin-landing-page/)

This project is a sample landing page from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) Foundations section. It is a made up Wine Club company. I borrowed heavily from [Winc](https://www.winc.com/) as I really liked the design of the website and it included a lot of things I hadn't worked with before such as linear gradients and SVG waves.
